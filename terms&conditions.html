        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Innovberg! We are thrilled to have you explore our services. By engaging with our offerings, you are entering into a binding agreement that outlines your rights and responsibilities as well as ours. We encourage you to read these Terms and Conditions carefully to ensure a smooth collaboration. Your acceptance of these terms is a prerequisite for utilizing any of our services, and by proceeding, you confirm that you understand and agree to abide by these conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Services Offered</h2>
        <p>At Innovberg, we pride ourselves on providing a comprehensive range of digital solutions tailored to meet the diverse needs of our clients. Our services include, but are not limited to, the development of responsive websites that adapt seamlessly to various devices, the creation of engaging landing pages designed to convert visitors into customers, and the redesign of existing websites to enhance their functionality and aesthetic appeal. Additionally, we specialize in producing high-quality promotional videos that effectively communicate your brand's message, managing your social media presence to boost engagement, graphic design services that visually represent your ideas, and managing targeted advertising campaigns on platforms such as Google and Meta. We strive to offer innovative solutions that not only meet but exceed your expectations.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Payment Terms</h2>
        <p>To initiate any project with Innovberg, we require a 30% advance payment of the total project cost. This advance serves as a commitment from both parties and allows us to allocate the necessary resources to begin your project. The remaining 70% will be due upon the successful completion of the project, at which point we will deliver the final products to you. Payment methods accepted include credit cards, bank transfers, and other options as specified in your proposal. We encourage you to ensure timely payments to avoid any delays in the project timeline, as work may be paused until the outstanding balance is settled.</p>

        <h2>3. Project Timeline</h2>
        <p>We understand that time is of the essence in the digital landscape, and therefore, we will provide you with an estimated timeline for project completion. However, please be aware that the timeline may be subject to change based on the scope of work, complexity of the project, and the promptness of feedback from your side. Open and timely communication is key; hence, we will keep you informed about any adjustments to the schedule as soon as they arise. We appreciate your understanding that unexpected challenges can occur, and we will strive to mitigate any delays while delivering high-quality results.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Revisions</h2>
        <p>We believe in a collaborative approach to ensure that the final output aligns perfectly with your vision. Clients are entitled to a specified number of rounds of revisions during the design phase, as outlined in your project proposal. These revisions allow you to provide feedback and request changes to ensure the final product meets your expectations. However, please note that additional rounds of revisions beyond those specified may incur extra charges. We encourage constructive feedback and aim to create a product that you will be proud to showcase.</p>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Upon full payment for our services, you will receive ownership of the final deliverables, including any websites, graphics, and videos created during the project. However, Innovberg retains the right to use the completed project in our portfolio and marketing materials, showcasing our work to potential clients. If you prefer that your project remains confidential and not publicly displayed, we are happy to discuss a mutual agreement to protect your intellectual property. Our goal is to ensure you are satisfied with the final product while also promoting our capabilities.</p>

        <h2>6. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>If a client wishes to cancel the project after work has commenced, it is essential to understand that the advance payment is non-refundable. This policy ensures that we can allocate resources effectively and compensate our team for the time invested. In the event of cancellation, clients may also incur charges for any work completed up to the point of cancellation. We encourage open discussions should you feel the need to cancel, as we value our relationship with our clients and aim to address any concerns that may arise during the project.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>While we strive to deliver the highest quality services, Innovberg shall not be held liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages that may arise from the use of our services. This includes, but is not limited to, loss of data, revenue, or business opportunities. Our liability is limited to the total amount paid by you for the services provided. By engaging with our services, you acknowledge and accept this limitation of liability as part of our agreement.</p>

        <p>These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [insert jurisdiction]. In the event of any dispute arising from these terms, both parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in [insert jurisdiction]. This ensures a fair resolution in a legally recognized setting, providing both parties with a clear understanding of their rights and obligations.</p>

        <h2>9. Amendments</h2>

We encourage you to review these terms periodically to stay informed of any updates. Continued use of our services following any amendments signifies your acceptance of the new terms.
